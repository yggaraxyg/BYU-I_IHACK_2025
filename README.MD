# Knowledge Knights
Test your knowledge in a dungeon crawler where the loot you get is obtained by your ability to remember information. Choose from a default study set, manually input questions and answers, or import your own csv file.
Choose your own conditions to win. Answer a certain amount of questions, survive for a period of time, go for a target score, or go endless!
Knowledge Knights seeks to incorporate studying with gameplay, increasing motivation to retain information by linking correct answers to rewards.
